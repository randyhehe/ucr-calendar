The following command line tools will need to be installed:
```
NodeJS. Verify working by testing out command 'node --version'. This should also come with npm (node package manager), test command 'npm'
Bower. (this is a npm package and requires npm to install). To install, type 'npm install -g bower'. Test to see if bower is working by running 'bower'
```

In the root of the directory run:
```
npm install
bower install
```

Test to see if app builds by running command 'node server.js' in root of the directory. Try accessing http://localhost:8080/ on your browser

Probably missing a lot of details and some installation steps. Let me know if you encounter an error.

I recommend quickly reading some information on MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS to know what they are and what they do. Then some articles on MEAN to better understand in a high level why we need all 4 of these to make a good web app.

This might be helpful in understanding some of the initial code in our project. There are some differences though.
